## Week 14: Tech Blog

This is my assignment to create a Tech Blog website utilizing RESTful API and a mySql database that follows a model structure for the different data types. 

I also used handlebars to load up the pages listed in the navbar, and display pertinent information within the bodies of those pages when necessary. 

## Tech Used:
handlebars
express
REST API
sequelize
mySQL

## Steps
The proces started with setting up the server and the connection commands to properly start the webpage. Once the server was able to be initiallized and utilize a 'localhost' connection, I could develop the handlebars. 

Handlebars started with the 'main.handlebars' as the boilerplate for the other pages, and I created additional layouts as other functions came into play. 

I also created 'seeds' of comments to fill the website with holder data for the time being and properly display website functionality. 

once the view was set, I created the routes to load the pages, edit the data in mySql, and post the data on the website. 

## Thanks
Thanks goes to the instructors Lee Peterson and Chad Lew, whom helped to instruct and aid in my learning these very important steps to creating functional websites. 

Thanks also to my tutor Namita Shenai for her aid and focus on specific problems I was facing in this project.
